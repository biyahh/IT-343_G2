        <h2> EVSU @118: Insights from the President</h2>
        <p>
            To celebrate the 118 glorious years of our beloved Eastern Visayas State University, we reflect on our journey as resilient we have excellence and transformation that has shaped this institution. Over a century ago, EVSU was founded with a vision to be a pillar of education and service in Leyte and in the Eastern Visayas region. That humble vision has guided us through generations and today we stand and reaffirm our commitment to shaping the future of our university through smart innovation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this year's theme, Building Futures through Smart Innovation encapsulates our collective aspiration to be at the forefront of a smart campus. Sustainable, modernized, accessible, responsible and transformative initiatives. So in today's world of technological advancements, innovation is the ultimate currency to fuel progress and redefine the future. The world is changing at an unprecedented pace and as an academic institution, we must evolve alongside it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our commitment to a future ready university is exemplified by our ambitious 1.5 billion smart campus enhancement project as part of the 5 billion development project. This is a testament to our dedication to innovation and global competitiveness. Once fully implemented across its three phases, this initiative will transform EVSU into a digitally connected and technologically advanced learning institution on par with other institutions in the ASEAN and even beyond. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            It will integrate state of the art infrastructure, smart classroom, Al powered systems and a seamless digital ecosystem that enhances learning, research and administrative processes. With this initiative, we are not only improving our facilities, but also redefining the EVSU learning experience. 
        </p>    
        <p>    
            So my dear EVSUnistas, this is my aspiration for all of us with the smart campus, our faculty, students and non teaching personnel will have access to digital learning platforms, high speed connectivity and cutting edge research tools preparing them to thrive in a globally competitive world. A smart campus means better facilities, better education and better EVSU. So I envision our beloved EVSU to lead the way, make the way and inspire the way. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            As we mark this milestone on our 118 years, I call upon each one of you here, dear faculty members, non-teaching staff, our dear students, our alumni, here present and our partner institutions to embrace this vision with unwavering commitment for its realization. The future of EVSU is shaped by our unrelenting pursuit for excellence, collective efforts and passion and of course dedication. Let us work together to ensure that the next chapter of our university's history is one greater innovation, stronger collaboration and lasting impact. But the 1.5 billion smart campus development project EVSU is not just keeping up with the times. We are setting a new and higher benchmark for excellence in education, research and service. We are building a future that is smart, sustainable and inclusive for all of us. EVSUnistas, this is our time to shine. This is our time to build a legacy for our university that will stand in the next 118 years and more years to come. And so, one as one EVSU, it is you, you and I. It is all of us that will shape the Future Together. Happy 118 Founding Anniversary Mabuhay and Eastern Visayas State University at Mabuhay po tayong lahat To God be all the glory. Thank you very much..
